**1. Manners**

    a) Control Your Anger And Spite:
        - Indecent language, hate, and racism will not be tolerated. 
        - Insulting sacred texts, Prophets, scholars, or well-respected religious figures will lead to consequences. 
        - This server will not tolerate hostile members nor those incapable of holding a proper discussion without abrasiveness. 
        - Nor will it tolerate passive aggressive, uncharitable, or insensitive behaviour to other members. 
        - The following actions can lead to warnings or a ban: defamation, ridicule, mockery, stalking, threats, harassment, intimidation and abuse.

    b) Maintain Etiquette:
        - Do not speak on matters you are not knowledgeable on.
        - Treat other members, including staff, with respect and decency.
        - Cite your sources when the subject requires it, such as with history or fiqh.
        - Always obey enforcers in the channels, and use the appropriate method of complaint, ModMail, when you want something looked into. 
        - Follow the purpose of the server. Anything that severely deviates from the purpose may result in enforcers cutting it off.
        - Don't bring drama from other servers here. Doing so will result in consequences.

    c) Do not use @mentions (pings) excessively or incessantly.
        - For example, do not excessively ping someone who is already in the discussion, nor ping someone who was already pinged for the purpose of discussing.
        - If a role is meant for a specific channel, then avoid pinging them outside of it. 

    d) Share content anonymously.
        - Any content shared from this server must be shared anonymously (no avatar or name) unless clear consent is given by the original poster.
        - For reporting someone for Trust and Safety reasons to admins of other servers, such as if that person is a troll or blasphemer, the Founder or Wazirs can be asked for an exception.

**2. Content**

    a) Keep the server clean:
        - Don't post violence, gore, or other graphic images or text.
        - Sexualised content will be dealt with heavy-handedly. In addition avoid displaying 'awra as much as possible.
        - Do not share content that treats trigger topics irreverently, including suicide and self-harm.

    b) Support of terrorist organisations and associated individuals will be swiftly cracked down on. Joking support will be treated as serious support.

    c) Post content in their appropriate channels. Avoid off-topic content.

    d) Discuss in your own words:
      - The discussion channels are for discussing in your own words. Do not link to external material, reproduce or quote the relevant parts instead.
      - Linking to reading material for the future, *after* the discussion, is allowed.
      - Do not link to external material when asking questions in #answering-doubts. Reproduce or quote the relevant parts for the Mujāwib.

    e) Respect people's privacy. Do not ask for private information.

    f) Do not engage in creedal debates. Creedal discussions are only permitted if explicit permission by Enforcers is granted.

**3. Formal Channels**

    a) Remain formal and disciplined. Informality includes: 
        - Excessive usage of emotes
        - Constantly cracking jokes
        - Constantly going "lol"
        - Mentioning things that are irrelevant to the topic at hand
        - Not responding to your interlocutor seriously.

    b) Avoid interfering in a healthy discussion.

    c) Avoid dogpiling:
        - Three, including the one being responded to, is a crowd. 
        - Four, or five may quickly result in enforcers kicking some people out of the discussion. 
        - The first to go ought to be the least knowledgeable, least formal and least professional interlocutors.

    d) Rule 1 is exceptionally emphasised: 
        - Keep passive aggressive talk and inflammatory remarks at the door.
        - Apply the principle of charity towards interpreting your interlocutors' points.

**4. Voice Channels**

    a) Rule 1 is emphasised again. Don't shout, curse, or be aggressive. 

    b) Keep the Divine Law regarding gender interactions in mind: 
        - Be professional to the other gender. 
        - Do not attempt to obtain private information, make advancements or go beyond the confines of acceptable male-female discourse in Islam. 
        - Violation of this is a very easy way to get banned.

    c) Discussion and class voice channels are treated like the formal text channels, and the same rules apply.

**Note:** Only ping @Enforcers for moderation and rule breaking incidents. @Managers are not moderators.

السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته
Marḥaban bikum!

Al-Zāwiyah, the Learning Circle, is where we immerse the average user in an environment focused on the pursuance of knowledge. An environment, not just for scholars, but for every Zayd, 'Amr, and 'Abd-Allah who intends to act upon the statement of the Emissary of God :saw:, "Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim." 

We ask from you, in return, to strive in maintaining manners and strive in keeping this environment good. 

May God grant us all understanding in the religion and knowledge that is beneficial.
